HAVOC is a fork of the PortaPack H1 firmware, a portability add-on for the [HackRF One software-defined radio](http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/).

Hardware is available at [ShareBrained Technology](http://sharebrained.com/portapack).

It is build on top of [ShareBrained's firmware](https://github.com/sharebrained/portapack-hackrf/).

# Documentation & finding help

* [Havoc wiki](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc/wiki)
* [PortaPack wiki](https://github.com/sharebrained/portapack-hackrf/wiki)
* [Some questions and answers](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc/issues)
* [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/177623356165819/) if that's your thing
* And a ton of posts on a variety of forums...

# Summary

As its name implies, HAVOC's functions can be fun, mean or even useful sometimes. You probably shouldn't use them. No ! Bad ! Put it down.

**In most countries, radio transmissions are tightly regulated. Transmitting outside of free/public bands without a licence or authorization, even at very low power, is certainly forbidden where you live. Always bear that in mind. You're the ONLY ONE responsible for what you do with this software.**

# Progress

Feature | Progress | Notes
------- | -------- | -----
POCSAG RX   | 95% | Needs support for numeric messages
Morse TX    | 95% | Needs fox hunt scheduler and live keying mode
Mic. TX     | 95% | Carrier leak bug, need to find guard tones for various brands of wireless mics
ADS-B RX    | 90% | Needs angle and speed decoding
Close-Callâ„¢ | 85% | Needs adjustments and optimization for wider frequency range
ADS-B TX    | 85% | Works but baseband module needs cleaning
SSTV TX     | 80% | Needs better bitmap file handling, support for other modes (ROBOT ?) and callsign FSK ID
Radiosondes | 75% | Needs support for other models
Wave visualizer | 70% | Needs cleaning and handling of other sample formats, high priority
AFSK RX     | 70% | Needs work regarding flexibility
Sigfox RX   | 40% | Tuning basics done, needs decoding code and testing
Generic TXs | 30% | Raw AX.25, AFSK, FSK, CCIR, DTMF... Tonesets are ready
CC1101 TRX  | 10% | And other sub-GHz transceiver chips like SI4032...
SSTV RX     | 0%  | 
Scanner     | 0%  | Easy, could be used with POCSAG RX to catch jumping channels
SSB TX      | 0%  | Requested but math is hard :(
OOK RX      | 0%  | See if rtl_433's author is fine with using protocol defs
Analog TV TX| 0%  | Enough CPU ? B&W and no sound ?
LoJack RX   | 0%  | Basically AFSK RX
DMR info RX | 0%  | Retrieve DMR channel info. **No voice** because of vocoder complexity and possible legal issue
Tetra info? | 0%  | Same

This is a fork of the [Havoc](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc/) firmware, which itself was a fork of the [PortaPack](https://github.com/sharebrained/portapack-hackrf) firmware, an add-on for the [HackRF](http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/). A fork is a derivate, in this case one that has extra features and fixes when compared to the older versions.

# Frequently Asked Questions

This repository expands upon the previous work by many people and aims to constantly add new features, bugfixes and generate documentation to make further development easier.  [Collaboration](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki/How-to-collaborate) is always welcomed and appreciated.

## Does it work on H1/H2 PortaPack?

Yes, both devices are the [same](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki/First-steps). The one I am using to test all changes is this [PortaPack H2+HackRF+battery](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_dSMPvNo), which is a kit that includes everything you need. Sadly, the people making the H2 never made the updated schematics available, which is not ideal (and goes against the terms of the license).

To support the people behind the hardware, please buy a genuine [HackRF](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/) and [PortaPack](https://store.sharebrained.com/products/portapack-for-hackrf-one-kit).

## Where is the latest firmware?

The current stable release is on the [![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/eried/portapack-mayhem?label=Releases&style=social)](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/releases/latest) page. Follow the instructions you can find in the release description. There is also [nightly builds](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/releases/tag/nightly) generated periodically, which include the latest commits, but they may contain incomplete or buggy functionality.

## Is this the newest firmware for my PortaPack? 
Most probably: **YES**. *If you find new features somewhere else, please [suggest](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/issues/new/choose) them*.

## Which one is actually the newest?
There is a lot of confusion of which is the latest version because no old version used any actual "version number". Additionally, since the files were distributed on facebook groups, github issue links and similar temporal sources, then there was no central location for them. 

This fork (**Mayhem**) uses *major.minor.release* [semantic versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning), so you can always compare your current version with the latest from [Releases](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/releases/latest).

## What about Havoc/GridRF/jamesshao8/jboone's?
* jboone's PortaPack: the [vanilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software) experience
* Havoc: It was the most popular fork of jboone's PortaPack, currrently, it is not being maintained nor updated
* jamesshao8: He keeps his own version of the fork, while not attached as a fork to anything
* GridRF: They sell PortaPack clones with their own firmware based on a old version, which has no sourcecode available

## How can I collaborate
You can write [documentation](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki), fix bugs and [answer issues](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/issues) or add new functionality. Please check the following [guide](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki/How-to-collaborate) with details.

Consider that the hardware and firmware has been created and maintain by a [lot](https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/graphs/contributors) of [people](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/graphs/contributors), so always try colaborating your time and effort first. For coding related questions, if something does not fit as an issue, please join our [Channel in Discord](https://discord.gg/fU9PsKW).

As a last option, if you want to send money directly to me for getting more boards, antennas and such:

## What if I need help?
First, check the [documentation](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki). If you find a bug or you think the problem is related to the current repository, please open an [issue](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/issues/new/choose).

You can reach the [official community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/177623356165819) in Facebook. 

## What if I find incongruencies, or grammatical errors in the text?
If is on the [Wiki](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki), you can modify it directly. If is on files of the repository, you can send corrections as [pull requests](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki/How-to-collaborate#coding-new-stuff-or-fixing-bugs). As a last resource, open an [issue](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/issues/new/choose).
